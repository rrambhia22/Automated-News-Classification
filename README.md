# Automated-News-Classification

As there are a lot of sources that generate an immense amount of daily news and the demand for information by users has been growing, 
there is a need to classify the news reports & articles into their respective categories.
A model was therefore built for automating the process of news classification in order to classify the news headlines into their respective categories 
where the Neural Network model (DNN) was implemented along with Natural Language Processing. 
The model was built for both English and Regional language (Gujarati). 
The input to the model can be either text input or audio input and when given an audio input, it would convert into textual format i.e. speech to text classification, 
and then classify.
There were various stages performed to complete this task such as Data Preparation, Model Building and Visual Analysis.
